## Setup

## Tailwind CSS Configuration
I setup Dark Mode & Themes for containers, padding, sizing etc, and extended certain UI components like border-radius, keyframes and animmations to keep the visuals consistent throughout the App.

## Getting Started
The Icon library being used is Lucide-React which is a light weight library
For Themes and UI Components I decided to go with ShadCN-UI. Which is a very seamless easy UI platform.

Technical Package Choices:
Kinde-OSS for Auth
Prisma as our ORM
PlanetScale as our MySQL Database
Zod for our TypeScript-first schema validation
